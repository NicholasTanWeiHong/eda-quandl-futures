## Future Plans
* Implementing some inferential analyses with the scikit-learn library
* Adding a section on Crack Spreads (E.g. Crude-Gasoline, Crude-Fuel Oil, Crude-Gasoil Spreads)
* Implementing technical indicators for each spreads (E.g. RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands)
* Integrating transporation data (E.g. Shipping costs from Rotterdam to East)
* Developing the project in Dash to create live graphs for each spread identified
