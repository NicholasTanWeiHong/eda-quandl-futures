## Future Plans
* Including graphs of freight rates between two locations for physical location arbs
* Implementing some inferential analyses with the scikit-learn library
* Adding a section on crack spreads (E.g. Brent-RBOB Gasoline, Brent-Fuel Oil, Brent-Gasoil Spreads)
* Developing the project in Dash to generate live graphs for each spread under analysis
* Implementing technical indicators for each spread in Dash (E.g. RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands)
* Deducing if arbs are open with a Dash app
