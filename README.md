## Future Plans
* Implementing some inferential analyses with the scikit-learn library
* Adding a section on crack spreads (E.g. Brent-RBOB Gasoline, Brent-Fuel Oil, Brent-Gasoil Spreads)
* Implementing technical indicators for each spreads (E.g. RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands)
* Integrating logistical cost data (E.g. Spot/Time Charter Rates from Rotterdam to Singapore)
* Developing the project in Dash to generate live graphs for each spread identified
